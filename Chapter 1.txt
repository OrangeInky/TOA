# Chapter 1 Section 0
In the night of K'hagar, the moon dimly lits the ground. spraying it's beauty sparsely on the colony of the mountain people. Piercing through the air with strength, embroidering it's charm on to the ground.

In the southern district of K'hagar, where the filthest beggar lived, there stand a figure of human height at one corner of the road. The figure is in the dark, none of the beggars noticed him, they would only find the figure to be clad in cloak even if they did.

However, if they are able to remove the cloak, they would find a boy with bloody mouth and a tightly held daggar. Indeed, the figure is Aku.

A group of beggars eventually got up as the moonlight become dimmer, they pulled rags with eye sockets on their face. The beggars quickly paced into the northern direction, after they are some distance away, Aku followed them closely. Moving out of the dark corner and following like their lurking shadow.

The beggars stopped before a resturant on the Eastern district, one of them leads the way and smashed some blunt object against the wooden door, busting it open. The group of beggars roamed inside the resutrant like rats.

They rushed into the kitchen, taking everything they see with them, they soon exited with foods stored in their baggy rags.

The lurking shadow that is Aku grabbed some breads after the beggars left.

Aku rest his back against the wall against the wooden door that he had broken yesterday. He chews on the bread and drinked some water that he also took from the resturant. Everyone in the association was sleeping, hard to imagine how, with such limited space. The cloak also keeps Aku warm, he borrowed it from Jalkar.

"Everyone have a way of surviving. Those beggars never get anything from begging, at least from what I've seen in the morning. So they have to steal food from resturants... But how are they able to sustain this?" Aku pondered deeply, even stopping his chewing.

"It almost feel like they are permitted to do such thing." Aku made a ridiculous conclusion, but that's the only intuitive explanation of this phenomenon that is in his mind right now. "They have been paying Pici to feed and take care of me for the past month, I will return a favor for them, eventually." Aku thoughts as he stares at the wooden door, it really is just a slab of wood.

"The northern district sounds interesting, maybe I will go there tomorrow. Just to see if I can make some money." Aku's eyelid felt heavy as he let out a light yawn, "That will be tomorrow's business."

In the very dim night, the boy sleep against the wall, covered by a cloak. If you look closely, you'd find his hand grasping tightly on a dagger.

"Why the hell are you here in front of our association?" Was the sentence that woke Aku up, Spring was looking at him intently, wanting an explanation.

"I can sleep where ever I want, and this is less an association than a hidey hole for you guys." Aku pointed out

Spring seem to turn visiblly red from anger, her chest heaving up and down, "Y-You, you are a stupid bastard! How dare you discredit the association like this!"

Zach came out from behind Spring, he seemed a bit surprised to see Aku here as well.  "Oh hey Aku, you could've slept with us if you wanted to."

Spring's already red face seem to climb another degree of red, almost turning black, "Hell no! I won't let this bastard sleep with us." She shouted.

"Stop being so moody in the morning."

"Shut your mouth!"

Zach and Spring started a fight, when they had finished, Aku was already gone.

The northern district was not so crowded in the morning, but there are still merchants selling merchandise this early.

At the end of the road that Aku can see, there was two guards, much taller and muscular than the guards guarding the southern gate. Having had a bad experience with these mountain people guards, Aku decided to step back and just look around.

The merchants here are not tall like the moutain people, some are like the size of Pici, while some are more human sized. But they are not human, with many different features. What they sell is quite interesting however, weapons and tomes are sold together, foods and odd-looking flasks that contain odd-looking liquids are sold together.

There are even merchants that sell what seem like rotten fleshes, broken bones, dying flowers and many other odd objects. Aku cannot immedieatly think of any use for them.

Some old merchant caught Aku's eye, he was selling the most extraordinary things Aku had ever laid eyes upon. Aku approached the old merchant that appear to be around the same size as Pici. "Young man, what are you looking for?" He can surprisingly speak human language, with a large smile.

"Can I see that clock?" Aku asked, the old merchant grabs the clock and present it to Aku.

"This is a clock from ancient antiquity time, many, many years ago. It is made of a variant metal that is impossible to find nowadays. It is said that the time displayed on this clock is a secret that would lead to great wealth if uncovered." As the old man is talking, loud, triumphant music was suddenly played.

Aku saw a towering man, with seven corpse of wolf laying on his broad shoulder, with a robe colored with bright red, dark gold, and plain white. Three medals on his chest. He walks with a confident stride as a marching band follows him.

Upon closer inspection, Aku realized just how massive the man truly is. Much taller than even the guards at the end of the road, roughly 5 meters tall in height. His arms are thick like tree trunks and hard like stones. The wolves look small relative to him. He has an long, blonde hair that falls freely till his hip. Aku have no doubt this man can kill a wolf with ease.

The man approached the guards, or rather the guards approached him. As they came forth, they bent their back and leaned forward, bowing their head to the man, infinitely less menancing. After some exchange, the man was let in the gate, during the whole conversation he never once lowered his head.

"Do you still want this clock?" The old merchant's voice pulled Aku back to reality, the sound of music still plays in his head.

"No, I do not have any money." Aku answered without much emotion, as if they were all drained away.

"I don't ask for money, give me something you think worth the same value." The old merchant said, he doesn't seem to be affected by what just happened.

"I don't have anything that worth as much as this relic." Aku said as he walked away, "You can come back next time," he heard. But his heart can no longer concentrate on anything the old merchant have to say.

The association of human race in K'Hagar

"Who is him?" Aku asked, leaning forward to Jalkar.

"How would I know? I can only say that he is a royalty based on your description." Replied Jalkar.

"Why do you care anyway? It's not like you will ever interact with him." Spring added.

Ignoring Spring's question, Aku pressed on, "He is the same ethinicity as those guards?"

"Yes, the mountain people is very different, some are born to achive more than others." Jalkar explained, he is too curious on why Aku asked, but he didn't say anything.

"Wolves, how did he even find those wolves?" Aku asked, Spring looked at him as if looking at an idiot, "The west gate leads to a forest, that's where people hunt."

Aku falls back on the chair in silence, seems to be thinking of something. Spring warned, "If you want to go there, remember that the deeper it is, the more dangerous it is. And a teenage boy like you should never be there anyway."

Without responding, Aku speed out the association. Spring frowned as he leaves, "What a weirdo." She murmured.

Aku had asked about Massie before, where did she find him. She told him that he was found far into the south, and said she don't know any water falls near by. So this begs the question, how far away is Aku from his village?

Aku does not care all too much about the village, and he isn't cared about in that village too. If he were to be back now, he'd probably be investigated for responsible for the missing of the chief's daughter. But what really matters is how fammilar looking is that royalty to the "Guardians" inside the village. Those guardians that rarely show themselves.

For Aku, surviving in this world is his goal, nothing other than that. He had no goal beyond just simply living, he had questioned his purpose in life before, but that is only when he'd be well-fed and well-nurtured; which is nearly never. He lives simply because he want to live, but after seeing that mighty man who carried seven wolves on his shoulder. Something awakend in Aku: a strive for power. He will most definitely be killed by that wolf if not for the risk he had take, but that man single-handedly slained seven wolves that are bigger and stronger.

The western road was rather less developed, nothing much was constructed. Overgrown grass show their toughness by clinging tight onto the stone wall, as if coloring the grey canvas with some green. The western district looks very different from the roads of other directions. As far as Aku can see, southern district was where foreigner came in, and the East is the main living and commercial center for non-mountain people, the North is the place of mountain people, the colonist of this land. But there seem to be even more beyond the city, one example is Pici's garden.

As Aku approaches the western gate, more people begin to emerge. One type of people Aku had never seen before, they have many much furs on their body. The texture seem to be resembling of wolf furs, but tougher and rougher. They are on average quite tall, just around the height of Jalkar. People gather in line before two guards.

Aku did not immedieatly join the line but rather observed on the side, and soon something odd begin to happen. Aku cannot see the guard's face even though they are so close, the surrounding become more and more foggy. Aku's own breath begin to slow down rapidly, until it stopped completely, his pupils dilated as things begin to morph around him. The overgrown grass become thicker and stronger as they move on their own, the wolf people approaches him. But nothing looked real, everything suddenly turned into a void as things morph faster and faster. A thought emerges in Aku's head, "You are the child of dream demon, let your blood burn and make your bloodline proud!"

The void suddenly morphs into a odd looking place, with towering buildings built of metal and neon lights that radiates Aku's world. A man wearing a uniform that have a spider in the chest section came forth, "You disrupted a canon event."

Then a strong pushing force returns Aku to the void.

A weird feeling tells Aku that the void is "Weaker", it is not something that quite make sense using logic. However, it just oddly made sense to Aku. He tries to move around in the void, but as he does, the space begin to morph again. This time, Aku end up in a familar place.

The same hill with the great waterfall behind Aku, the blood-thirsty wolf inching closer to Aku. The only difference now was that there is a knife in Aku's hand., along with the cloak he borrowed from the association.

"What?" Aku thinked to himself, "Why am I at this place again." His heart beats incrediblly fast. He looks back at the waterfall, he never noticed how deep it looked, as if the whole universe was contained in it.

"I am not going to jump off this time." Aku turned his head back to the wolf, his hand grasping the knife tighter.
