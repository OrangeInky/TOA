#Section 1

The sun was going to sleep, it's brightness turned wheat-gold, everything looks darker in this time of day. Letting the working farmers know it is time to stop and get some rest.

"Heehee, keep chasing me little missy!", says a figure as he jogs in the open road. A little girl follows behind him, she seem to be at the age of six or seven, barely catching up with the much older boy.

Aku was suppose to go to school in the city at his age, but being a orphan in the village made it impossible to get any fiancial support from any relatives. The best he could do was to babysit the chief's daughter to earn some scraps of gold.

"I am tired! Stop running so fast!", Kascade, the chief's daughter and "the most precious person in town" bemoans.

With a smirk, Aku turned around and grab Kascade. "I thought little missy love to run all day?", Aku said with his head raised slightly higher.

The youthful Kascade helds her arms together and puffed her face, turning away from Aku's smirk.

"HOWL!", a loud howling suddenly emerges from behind. Almost turning the exact instant the howl was heard, Aku saw a massive wolf, much larger than anything he can even imagine. It have strong muscular legs like a bull, and a wide chest like a gorila. 

In the next instant, Aku grabbs Kascade and begin running for their life.

"Dang it, why is there a wolf around this region?", Aku cursed wordlessly in his head, Kascade seem to be in too much shock to even process exactly what is going on. With experience in the surrounding of the village, Aku knows that they are roughly a two minutes away from the village. 

"I just need to run to the village so the guardians can help!", having a clear goal in his head, Aku sprints toward the direction of the village.

The path was clear with no visible obstacles, and within seconds the wolf begin to catch up with Aku and Kascade with it's explosive legs. The dangerous predator leaped forward as Aku become in reach.

In a moment's desperation, Aku choose to roll with Kascade in his arm to a completely different direction to the village. Knowing that the wolf was much faster than him on a straight and clear path and he would very much be outrunned. 

Immedieatly after rolling away Aku stood up, he doesn't felt much pain even rolling on sharp stones on the ground.

Wasting no time, Aku raced forward into the deep forest, still with Kascade in his arm.

The deep forest was full of trees covering one's eye sight. In such environment a show was present, the fast and hungry wolf chasing down the two kids.

"I am scared!" Kascade suddenly cried with tears in her eyes. Her sharp cries seem to entice the wolf further. "Shut the hell up!" Aku roared in rage, as he again have to roll on the floor to dodge the wolf's leap. It was quite fortunate he had done it once without a wound, but this second time he wasn't so lucky. With lower stamina and faster predator, Aku earned himself a deep wound on the back.

"Fuck fuck fuck fuck." Aku yelled as he felt blood draining from his body, sprinting felt much more difficult with the lost in stamina. With a sudden and sharp glance at Kascade, Aku grit his teeth and said quietly, "sorry."

Kascade was still crying and cannot hear what Aku was saying, but with a determined effort, Aku forciblly throwed Kascade behind him, launching her directly past the chasing wolf.

The small body of the girl was launched in the air like some helpless ragdoll, the wolf turned it's head and chased the opposite direction. Aku grimaced with a red eye, continuing to run without stopping. He didn't know how long he had been running for, but he know it had been long enough for him to run out of stamina completely.

Aku stopped at a steep edge of the jungle, he never knew there was such a place here deep in the jungle. A grande and amazing waterfall, like universe falling down on earth. Such scenery does not make things any more pleasing for Aku, quite the opposite: Aku was trapped.

A crazed laughter is let out by Aku, "Nobody cared about me anyway." He thinks to himself as his heart pounds faster than ever, and his back now completely bloody. 

He sat at the top of the hill, hundreds of meter above the stream originating from the waterfall. With another laughter as the same wolf approached Aku, it's teeth bloody.

"It was all for nothing." A third laughter and Aku jumps off the hill.

#Section 2

When Aku had woken up again, he examines his surrounding. It is a small wooden cabin, very compact with a height that looks no taller than 2 meters and a width no longer than 3 meters, giving this place a depressive feeling.

"Where am I..." Aku thinks to himself, before getting off the small bed and standing up. Once awoken, he realized he was not alone. A smallish brown creature sleeps on the ground.

With a frown, Aku carefully steeped away from the creature without awaking it. He walks outside the wooden cabin and finds himself in what looks like a garden. With flowers and small bushes all around him. What is before him was a cobble-stone paved road which have a end that cannot be seen.

Aku shook his head as a bad headache makes him groan. Frowning even more, he walks around the Garden and looks at the flowers, which had many variety. But his eye doesn't seem all to fixated on what he is seeing, but rather aimless.

"So you have awoken! I can finally get my superior bed back!" A high-pitched voice came from behind.

"Where am I?" Aku turned around and sees the brown creature. "What are you?" Aku added.

"What a rude human you are, but I guess that is expected from you arrogant humans." The brown creature huffed and heaved his chest. "Come on, follow me. I don't want to see you here again!" The little fellow groaned as his anger seem to subside.

"I am Pici, a @!)\*$ gardener here." The little fellow, or better known as Pici answered as he leads Aku on the stone-paved road. "I am sorry, a what?" Aku asked, unsure if he had heard him right.

"Ugh, @!)\*$, I don't know how to speak it in human terms." Pici complained, he was surprisingly fast for his build, walking with strides.

Knowing it would be futile effort to interrogate on this topic further, Aku changed the subject, "You are the one that have been taking care of you. I thank you very much." He expressed his gratitude, with his body slightly bend forward.

"It's not me who was taking care of you, I merely borrowed you a place to live. It was a human woman that was treating you, thank her instead." Pici said, his tone felt softer.

"Still, thank you." After that, Aku stayed silent for the rest of the walk.

After some distance had gone by, the stone-paved road that felt like an eternity finally show it's end. A massive palace built of grey stones and green leaves shows it's magnificent form for the two.

Through out the road, Aku had seen many simmilar wooden cabins, so he was naturally inclined to think less of their destination. "That is where we are heading?" Aku asked incredulously.

"That is where YOU are heading, I have no business there. Boss is usually the only one that would go to the main base." Pici answered, "You can walk by yourself now, I need some good sleep after these days."

After some more walking, Aku was at the gate. The four guards that secure the gate was weird looking, and definitely not human. They are not short like Pici, they are at the complete opposite end of the spectrum: Being extremely tall, looking about 3 meters tall in height. Their body is also proportionally wider, giving them a heavy look. They reminded Aku of those guardians in the village, not in physical stature, but the odd sense of inferiority when confronting them.

The guard wasn't clad any heavy armors, just dressed in regular fabrics. They do however; have a heavy sword on their back, making them look even more menancing. As Aku approach them, one of the guards draws his sword and points at Aku, making sure he would stop moving.

The sword-pointing guard smirks as one of his fellow guards said something Aku cannot quite comprehend. "You a human boy?" Asked the smirking guard, he have a weird accent but Aku can still understand him.

"Yes, I am sent here b-", Aku was interrupted as the sword was draw near his throat. "I didn't ask you anything more! Human boy." The guard looks displeased.

A light quickly flashed in Aku's eye. Being an orphan in the village had taught him many things, one of them is to always act situationally and avoid direct conflict. Despite doing this for years, he does not fear confronting anyone. But he know now is not the time. "Sorry", Aku said meekly as he lowers his head and faces the ground.

"Why don't you look at me? You are afraid of me?" Asked the guard, as he slowly stepped forward and drew his sword back. "No Sir, I-", Aku was once again interrupted, this time much more physical as the guard's large foot drives into Aku's mouth, breaking a few teeth. And without being able to protest another word or even act, another kick landed on Aku's stomach.

Aku curled painfully into a shrimp like position on the ground as his mouth bleeds out blood. The guards roared in laughter, saying something in language Aku cannot understand. But he can imagine it wasn't some compliment.

Aku eventually stood up again as the laughter died down. He approach the guards again, still with his head down. The guards looks at Aku with smugness, "Alright human boy, we've had our fun. After you get in the main city, go eastward until you see a small banner. It's in human writing."

Aku finally took his head up and smiled at the guard, his mouth lacking a few teeth and blood drips out of his mouth. "Thank you, please tell me your name so I may repay you with kindness in the future", Aku said.

The guard that knows human language hesistate for a second as he examines Aku's face, a odd chill runs down his spine as his eye is met with Aku's. He said with a frown, "Inrougnis, now get the hell in."

Aku walked past Inrougnis the guard, before he enters he took another look at him, still smiling, "Thank you."

"Inrougnis..." Aku murmured the guard's name under his breath, as he walked inside the massive structure they call the main city.

# Section 3

Inside the gate that Inrougnis guards is a paved path that leads to somewhere. Remembering what Inrougnis said, "Go eastward until you see a small banner." Aku assumed there would be some sort of splitting paths at the end of this road.

"Pici and Inrougnis, I've never met anything like them in the village. And they kept refering to me as 'human', as if they know my race." Aku pondered wordlessly as he walked down the road, "How exciting, I don't have to stay in that doomed village." Aku rubbed the blood off his mouth using his garment, they were completely new and seem to be tailored specifically for him.

There wasn't that many people even with the sun hanging high on the sky. Initially, on each side of the road was guard houses, filled with armor clad soldiers. Then as Aku go deeper, the guard houses begin to thin down and reached what felt like a slum, with hungry bums staring at him.

Sensing the danger, Aku speeds up his pace and walked faster, almost running even. Seeing this as a sign of meekness, one of the vagrant charged toward Aku with a knife.

"Fucking robbers," Aku cussed as he spreads his leg and run, "Hopefully the end of this road would be better."

The knife-wielding bum did not stop chasing Aku, he can surprisngly sprint quite fast despite his boneylooking leg.

"Tsk," after getting some distance away from the group of beggars Aku suddenly turned around and rush toward the vagrant, kicking him in the stomach before he realize what is going on. He collapse as the impact of the kick, Aku did not waste this opportunity and hop to trample the beggar's head. Being young and fierceful while the beggar is old and skinny, Aku took this advantage and gaved the beggar a solid crush on the head. Concussing the beggar.

Aku took hold of the beggar's knife then walked away without looking back.

After getting away from the slum, the housing and even environment gets much better. With plants as decoratives and cleaner side walks in general along with small houses. The population seem to get denser here as well.

Aku notices these difference as he observes his surrounding, but quickly returns his sight to the splitting path in front of him. There was three more paths on all the three other directions, it seemd that Aku had camed in from the south gate.

There is a massive statue, 3 meters in diameter and 10 meters in height erect right in the center of the crossroad. It vaguely resembles a four-faced woman, each face showing a different expression with a total of eight arms and eight legs.

The north side is specifically wider and fancier than all the other side combined, Aku can see some large banners in language he cannot read, and many more people moving around.

Aku turns to the east path and walked away, he had attracted some attention on the road with a blood stained shirt. He hides his dagger in his pant after moving past the slum so it is not too detectable.

As Aku walk on the east-ward path he takes notice of all the banners, trying to find the one that is in human language. Walking down the road, he sees many of what seem to be commercial stores and resturants.

Eventually, Aku did come across a banner with human language written on it, it reads: "The association of human race in K'Hagar." Aku had to confirm twice that it is what it reads, not because he didn't understand the language, but because of how terriblly small the building in front of him is. He doubts it can even held more than 5 chairs to hold a meeting.

The building was much more old-fashioned in comparison to other buildings on the same path. It look like something built a few decades ago, with many stains that covers up the door; which is curiously on the side and not on the front.

The building was at max 3 meters tall, definitely not suitable for those massive guards that guard the city. It is more of a small cabin than a house for living. With a small frown, Aku knocked on the door, it feels metallic, although it is too dirty to tell.

Upon knocking, the door proof to be not resilient enough to even withstand some knocking, it soon cracks open and falls back into the cabin. A angry shout came out from the cabin, it sounds like a woman.

"UGHHH, now I have to fix this damn door again.", the voice groaned in frustration, quite loud, too.

A figure walked out of the door frame, she have a quite androgynous face with a somewhat sharp set of features. The only thing that can suggest her status as a woman is her voice, her lack of curve and figure made her appear less attractive in a traditional sense, but that also made her quite remarkable in some twisted sense. Her face wasn't ugly nor beautiful, just average. Her ordinary feature wasn't helped with her plain black hair that barely reaches past her neck.

Before neither Aku or the female was able to talk any further, a timid voice came from inside.

"Wait, is that him?" Asked the less audible voice.

"Who?... Oh, *him*?" Answered the short-haired woman.

Another woman camed out of the door frame, just behind the short-haired woman. This one is a lot more striking than the short-haired girl.

First of all, she have a really small stature, looking to be barely 150cm tall. But contary to her small stature, her hair was very long, almost 4/5 of her body. Secondly, she has a ebony complexion that gave her an exotic appearence when contrasted with her grey dress and doll that she helds in his arm. She was prettier than the short-haired girl in Aku's standarnd.

Then another person camed out, a young boy just taller than the short haired girl but shorter than Aku. He have an bright eye that is staring curiously at Aku. Those eyes are soft, yet his eyebrows are quite slanted and straight, giving him a contrasting sharpness. If Aku was to describe him with one word just based off his appearence: Justice. It is some odd combination of his physical traits that made this youngster appear righteous, it is hard to describe without physically seeing him.

"Was he the boy that Massie found and helped?" The boy's voice was still high, suggesting the fact that he was a bit younger than Aku, who have a somewhat lower voice.

"You saved me?" Aku asked, looking at the short girl that is apparently called Massie.

Seeing Aku's stare, the taller girl quickly moves herself to stand in front of Massie blocking Aku's sight.

"Hey! I am Spring, the utmost authority of this association, if you want to talk, talk with me.", the short-haired girl said.

"No you are not." The boy murmured under his breath.

"Shut up!" Spring yelled.

"Pici sent me here." Aku confronted the defensive Spring, who was raising her head and chest as high as possible.

Massie whispered something to Spring, before hiding behind Spring again. Spring took a minute to ponder, Aku did not say anything and wordlessly awaits her response.

"Well, you can probably see right now, we do not have much space here in the association." Spring begins, but the boy interrupted, "But we need more people to help with the association too!"

"Shut up!" Spring shouted again, but Massie also camed foward and again whispered in her ear.

After some visible change of expression, from a contemplating face to a tight eye-brow to finally a compromising sigh and relaxation of the facial muscle.

"Fine, you can stay here at the association." Spring sighed.

"I never say I wanted to stay." Aku replied.

"WHAT?" Cried both Spring and the young boy.

"Shut up!" Shouted Spring a second after the synchronized response. After clearing her throat and calming down a bit, Spring talks again.

"Well, I do not know why you would reject this opportunity, maybe you understand now that we don't have many placement in the association right now. But you may come back in the future." Spring explained.

"I said I am not joining, I just want to know more about this place." Said Aku.

"Come inside then." Spring says, turning back and leading Aku inside.

The young boy goes up to Aku as Spring and Massie step back into the room, "Please join, we really needed more people. The space is not a problem, and Spring is just a bit vigilant, she meant no harm. My name is Zach by the way."

"Nice to meet you Zach." said Aku as he steps inside the room with a smile, although his bloody mouth made it less friendly and more terrifying, but Zach just grabbed the back of his head and smiled back.

"Yo Jalkar! There is a new guy here." Shouted Spring as they stepped in. The room was a bit bigger in the inside, but still very small.

No one was responding. "Yo Jalkar!" Spring shouted loudly. The room was dimly lit, and Spring seem to be talking toward the only lightsource.

When Aku followed Spring's sight, he sees a figure sitting on a chair much too small for his height. A stainless white coat cladding his body. His short blue hair is quite eye-catching, his hand is in rapid motion as he jots down something on a notebook. Leaning forward slightly to peek, Aku can only see weird symbols that he had never seen before, messy and quickly-written.

"Jalkar is our oldest and smartest guy here, he knows the most about here." Zach says to Aku in a small volume.

"JALKAR!" Spring shouted on top of her lung. Finally, Jalkar stood up, "Yes! Finally!" He exclaimed as he held his note-book in his chest. Standing up, he is quite a bit taller than Aku, but still no where near the height of those giant guards guarding the south gate.

Jalkar turned around and see Spring staring at him, "Uh, yeah?" His green eye moved around rapidly as he examines his surrounding, as if just awakening from a dream.

"This was the guy Massie talked about last month, he want to know about K'hagar." Spring said weakly, seems like all the shouting had exhausted her spirit.

Jalkar turned to see Aku, his green eye fixating on Aku's blue one. After a few second of eye contact, "Hmm, sit down on that chair." Jalkar pointed toward one of the chairs.

As Aku sat down on the chair, Jalkar sat down before him with his legs crossed and stretched forward and his back laying on the chair completely, extending his posture. There was no table.

"What do you want to know?" Jalkar asked, his voice was clear.

"Where is here, this K'hagar place." Aku asked his first question.

"Well, that's a long history. But long stories short, this place was a colony of the Great Empire of King's Mountain. Prominently made up of mountain peoples, the natives here was near extinct, we are the only group of humans left in this city."

Aku's heart dropped at the news, after a moment of silence, "Is there a better place to live for us humans?"

"Not anywhere near, this is one of the more peaceful cities, relatively speaking. I'd suggest you to just stay here." Jalkar explained.

"Where did you all come from?"

"Here," Said synchronously by Spring and Zach.

"Empire of The Sun..." Said Massie, her volume is quite low.

"Beyond the sky." Said Jalkar with a mysterious grin.

Aku contemplated, "Where do I make money?"

"As humans in K'hagar, you don't." Zach said jokingly, although Aku can hear some bitterness in his voice.

"If you can, visit the northern district, that's where the monarchs lived." Jalkar provided an answer, then he warned, seeing Aku's bloody mouth, "Do not interact with the mountain people, they don't like us."

"Thank you, that's all I have to ask, I will take my leave." Aku stood up.

"I'd suggest you to stay with us, we will be the most friendly people you will encounter in K'hagar. And we speak the same language, not everyone know how to speak our language here." Jalkar suggested, and Zach shoot a pleading look too.

"...I'll think about it. Maybe I will." Aku replied.

"We are always up for another friend in this city." Jalkar said.
